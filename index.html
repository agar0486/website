            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br> - We were introduced to multiple websites and how to navigate them. Although it was a lot to understand, I got the hang of it. We then were shown the importance of safety in the class room. Using glasses and minding your surrondings are a couple things to keep in mind. Shortly after we were challenged to keep a marble going through pvc pipes as a team.

            8/28-8/31 Week 2 <br> - This week we went over the various slides about Mechanical Engineering. We were also introduced to a new website called TinkerCad. At the end of the week we were challenged to build an appliance out of TinkerCad and I chose to make a bedroom.
